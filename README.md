This is the code for METEOR robot that uses NODEMCU, a ESP8266 microchip based development board, to connect to smartphone and perform tasks.
The bot also has an automatic line follower modewhich can be toggled through the app. NODEMCU originally has Arduino flashed onto it but, we uploaded MicroPython, a python interpretor on it so that we could have the ease of using python websockets.
